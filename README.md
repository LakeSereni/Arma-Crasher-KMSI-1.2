# Arma_Crasher
Arma Array Memory Waster, based on Spoody's SQF protection.

 ### Delivery: <h3/> 
 ProfileNamespace Variable -> <br/>
 Compile -> <br/>
 Broadcast compile to each user -><br/>
 User complies the code on each machine and then executes it (Bypasses the need for fnc_exec_vm or any other function delivery fnc's) -> <br/>
 Bis_fnc_mp (Less bells and whistles with remoteexec ( even though it's just an alias at this point )).<br/>
 
However you may gawk at bis_fnc_mp and I do as well, but its the only way of transfering the code in it's state I really had the time to look into, unless you are confident you have another method in which you can easily adapt the network function.
